By registering as a User, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted (such information being the “Registration Data”) and maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate, current and complete.

    </p>

    <h3>Account Password and Security</h3>
    <p class="content">
        At the time of registration for online account access, each User must provide a valid email address and supply a Username and Password to be used in conjunction with such User’s account. A User may not use a Username that promotes a commercial venture or a Username that TradeDuel in its sole discretion deems offensive. Many portions of the Service require registration for access (the "Restricted Areas"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Username and Password, and are fully responsible for all uses of your Username and Password, whether by you or others. You agree to (a) never to use the same Password for the Service that you use or have ever used outside of the Service; (b) keep your Username and Password confidential and not share them with anyone else; (c) immediately notify TradeDuel of any unauthorized use of your Username and Password or account or any other breach of security; and (d) use only your own Username and Password to access the Service’s Restricted Areas.

TradeDuel, in its sole and absolute discretion, may disqualify any User from a contest, or the entire Service, and refuse to award point(s) or prize(s), and/or require the return of any prize, or suspend or terminate your account, if you engage in conduct TradeDuel deems, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be improper, unfair or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Service or in any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is not limited to: falsifying personal information required to use the Service or claim a prize; violating any of these rules, accumulating points or prizes through unauthorized methods such as automated scripts or other automated means; tampering with the administration of the Service or trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with the Service; obtaining other entrants’ information and spamming other entrants; and abusing the Service in any way; or otherwise violating these Terms & Conditions.

    </p>
    <p class="content">
        If for any reason the Service is not running as originally planned (e.g., if the Site becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if infection by a computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, actions by entrants, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes of any kind, in the sole opinion of TradeDuel corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Service), TradeDuel reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual implicated in or relating to the cause and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend the Service, and select the winner(s) from all eligible entries received. If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs, notification may be posted on the Site.

    <p class="content">
        The failure of TradeDuel to comply with any provision of these Terms & Conditions due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of TradeDuel (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms & Conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Publicity</h3>
    <p class="content">
        By entering a game or contest, each User consents to TradeDuel’s and its service providers’ and business partners’ use of the User’s name, voice, likeness, and photograph in connection with the development, production, distribution and/or exploitation (including marketing and promotion) of the selected contest and/or other TradeDuel contests and TradeDuel generally, unless otherwise prohibited by law. Contest winners agree that, from the date of notification of their status as a potential winner, and continuing until such time when notified that they no longer need to do so, they will make themselves available to TradeDuel for up to 50 hours (or a higher quantity where specified by the rules of particular contests) of publicity, advertising and promotional activities relating to the contest or other TradeDuel products, services or events, without additional compensation. TradeDuel and its business partners reserve the right to make public statements about the entrants and winner(s), on-air, on the Internet, or otherwise, prior to, during, or following the contest. Entrants agree that TradeDuel may announce any winner's name on-air or on any of its websites or any other location at any time in connection with the marketing and promotion of TradeDuel or other contests or games operated by TradeDuel. You agree that participation in and (where applicable) the winning of a prize in connection with a contest constitute complete compensation for your obligations under this paragraph, and you agree not to seek to charge a fee or impose other conditions on the fulfillment of these obligations. The rules specific to certain contests may contain additional publicity obligations or may require a written signature on a separate publicity waiver.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Game Rules</h2>
    <h3>Game of Skill</h3>
    <p class="content">
        TradeDuel is a game of skill. Winners are determined by the criteria stated in each game(s) rules. (For purposes of these Rules “game” is also a “contest”.) For each contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant stock trading information and fantasy stock rules to accumulate the highest % fantasy return on the stocks used in a player’s (User) “starting lineup.” Fantasy points are accumulated through the performance of individual stocks across throughout the defined period of game play as noted in the specified contest rules. All entries in TradeDuel must be made up of stocks drawn and selected to “the starting lineup” for the time period listed in the contest rules.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry fees</h3>
    <p class="content">
        Outside of the USA:  Each TradeDuel contest has an entry fee listed in USD. When you opt to participate in a contest, that amount in USD will be debited from your TradeDuel account. Then, follow the links and instructions provided for entry. In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person submitting an entry, the entry will be deemed submitted by the person in whose Username the entry was submitted, or if possession of the Username itself is contested and in TradeDuel’s opinion sufficiently uncertain, the name in which the email address on file was registered with the email service provider. TradeDuel reserves the right not to award a prize to an individual it believes in its sole discretion did not submit the winning entry.
    </p>

    <h3>Contest Term</h3>
    <p class="content">
        TradeDuel offers contests for multiple stock trading days generally taking place on a single day, multiple days, a week, multiple weeks, a month or multiple months.
    </p>

    <h3>Prizes</h3>
    <p class="content">
        In the US: -----No cash prize. Players are playing for fun.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Outside of the USA: After each contest ends, the tentative winners are announced (generally by the following day) but remain subject to final verification. The players in each contest who accumulate the highest % portfolio returns and comply with eligibility requirements and applicable rules will win prizes as set out in the posted contest details. Prizes are added to the winning team's account balance. In the event of a tie, the prize is divided evenly between the tied players, unless otherwise specified.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        TradeDuel offers a number of different types of contests. For each contest, we announce the entry fees and prizes in advance on the contest page. For a summary of entry fees and prizes for currently open contests please login and visit the main lobby or look at the specific rules for each contest.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Prize calculations are based on the results as of the time when final scoring is tabulated by TradeDuel. Once winners are initially announced by TradeDuel, the scoring results will not be changed in light of official adjustments made by the professional leagues, though we reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in the transmission of information to us from our stats provider or in our calculation of results. We also may make adjustments in the event of noncompliance with the Terms. TradeDuel has no obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of any adjustment, and we reserve the right to reverse payments in the event of any adjustment. You agree to cooperate with our efforts to reverse payments.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        No substitution or transfer of a prize is permitted. All taxes associated with the receipt or use of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of the Contest is challenged by any legal authority, TradeDuel reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award or adjust such prizes. In all disputes arising out of the determination of the winner of TradeDuel contests, TradeDuel is the sole judge and its actions are final and binding.
    </p>

    <h3>Notification</h3>
    <p class="content">
        Winners are generally posted on the Site after the conclusion of each game by 5 PM EST on the same day. Winners may be requested to return via email or regular mail an affidavit of eligibility, a publicity agreement and appropriate tax forms by a specified deadline. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in disqualification. Any prize notification returned as undeliverable may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner. In addition, a list of winners and winner's names for each competition period may be obtained by writing to: support@tradeduel.finance, 159 Eastern Parkway Apt 1B Brooklyn, NY 11238
    </p>

    <h3>Taxation</h3>
    <p class="content">
        You, not TradeDuel, are responsible for filing and paying applicable state and federal taxes on any winnings.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        For US residents, all winners who have won $600 or more over the previous year must provide updated address and social security details to TradeDuel. These details will be used to allow TradeDuel to comply with tax regulations and may be shared with appropriate tax authorities.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        For non US residents, you are solely responsible for recording, paying and accounting to any relevant governmental, taxation or other authority for any tax or other levy that may be payable on any winnings paid to you. TradeDuel does not offer tax advice.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonuses and Promotions</h3>
    <p class="content">
        Except in the United States of America, We frequently offer bonuses to newly depositing Users and for other marketing purposes. Pending bonus is converted into a player’s cash account as the player enters real money contests. Unless otherwise stated, any unconverted pending bonus remaining in a player’s account 45 days after it has been initially credited can be removed by TradeDuel. Any cash bonus a new user receives is for entry into competitions on TradeDuel and can only be withdrawn if they have been previously entered into contests that amount to at least 5x the bonus amount. Additionally, if a user immediately withdraws money after a deposit which delivers a deposit bonus then the bonus will be retracted. In the event of abuse of the bonus system by any user, TradeDuel reserves the right to retract your user bonuses.
    </p>

    <h3>Withdrawals Generally</h3>
    <p class="content">
        For any withdrawals we require a valid mailing address, date of birth and valid social security number or any other material to run a valid identity check in order to file the appropriate tax forms at year end. We also may conduct checks for terms compliance, including anti-fraud checks on playing patterns and deposits prior to processing a withdrawal, and we may request additional information before permitting a withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        In cases where you have received a bonus or other benefits as a result of your deposit and have not yet played through the deposit (entering contests whose total entry fees equal the value of the deposit), TradeDuel reserves the right to refuse the withdrawal and/or close the your account.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="content">
        The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms & Conditions, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms & Conditions are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.

The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.

That being said, we attempt to limit access to personal information to those of our employees and agents (a) who need to know such information in order to help us provide the website and services available via the website, and (b) who are subject to confidentiality obligations.

        <em>When this Privacy Policy applies.</em> Our Privacy Policy applies to our services, but may not apply to the services of others that you may access or learn about via our website.  The services of others may not have a privacy policy, or their privacy policy may be less favorable to you.  It is your responsibility to find, evaluate, and understand the privacy policies of others.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        <em>Compliance and cooperation.</em> If we become aware of something unusual or have a question, then we may contact you to learn more.  Also, if we receive complaints, often we will contact the person who made the complaint, as well as the person being complained about.  If we contact you it does not necessarily mean there is a problem – we may simply be trying to determine whether there is a problem, or trying to discover ways to improve our services so that problems do not occur.  We may consult and work with regulatory authorities and others to resolve complaints or situations that cannot be resolved easily by us.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        <em>Changes.</em> We may change this Privacy Policy.  Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our website.  We will keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy for your review, and make those prior versions available to you upon request.  If you have ideas regarding how we can improve our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at support@TradeDuel.finance.

    <p class="content">
        If we introduce a new privacy policy, then we may or may not seek your consent to that new policy.  If we seek your consent, and you do not consent to a new privacy policy that we introduce, then you may not be allowed to use our website.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Also, if we introduce a new privacy policy, then we may notify you by email when we think it prudent to do so.  For this reason, and others, it is important that we have your current email address, your email filters (including any spam filters) allow our emails to reach you, and you read your emails soon after they arrive.
